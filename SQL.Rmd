# `SELECT` columns

The most fundamental SQL skill is how to `SELECT` one or more columns. 

1. `SELECT` is well covered in the first chapter of the DataCamp course [Introduction to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql){target="_blank"}. 

2. And the [w3schools SELECT tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_select.asp){target="_blank"}.

Broadly, you simply list the columns you need after the `SELECT`, or put an * to select all of the columns. 

# `FROM` tells SQL where the data is and lets you `JOIN` tables

There isn't really a training course on how to use `FROM` for one table. You simply put the table name after the `FROM`. However, when you want to join tables this where your `FROM statement will get more complex. 

A common way to explain the joins you can use in a `FROM` statement is with Venn diagrams like these:

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, out.width = "100%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/joins.png") 
```

  <summary>Note that some reject the Venn diagram explanation for joins</summary>

Though some reject the Venn diagram explanation and say [Say NO to Venn Diagrams When Explaining JOINs](https://blog.jooq.org/2016/07/05/say-no-to-venn-diagrams-when-explaining-joins/){target="_blank"}. Instead they explain that all joins begin with a `CROSS JOIN` (where every row on the left table is combined with every row on the right table), then all other joins (e.g. `INNER JOIN`) are a filtered version of that `CROSS JOIN`.

Though please note that cross joins themselves are, *"..potentially an expensive and dangerous operation since it can lead to a large data explosion. It is best used in scenarios where a normal join cannot be used and very selective predicates are being used in the WHERE clause to limit the number of produced rows"* [Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/u-sql/statements-and-expressions/select/from/joins/cross-join). In other words, if you do use a cross join, make sure it is filtered with a `WHERE` clause.

1. Joins are covered in this Oracle Tutorial [Joining Tables](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_G00HFQ7L5MB5BJ2K9612EDNWB.html){target="_blank"}.

2. And chapters 1 and 2 of the Datacamp course [Joining Data in SQL](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql){target="_blank"}. While this course is for the Postrgres flavour of SQL, you will find the methods will work in most flavours (e.g. Oracle or Microsoft SQL Server). 

# `WHERE` will filter rows

1. The Oracle tutorial [Querying and Filtering Rows](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_FIYST7OOFBN2ESHA54YUV6WN8.html){target="_blank"} shows you how to use`WHERE` to filter rows.

2. Also, see chapter 2 of the DataCamp course [Introduction to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql){target="_blank"}.

3. And the [w3schools WHERE tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_where.asp).

# `GROUP BY` will aggregate rows by the values in one or more other columns

After you have used `SELECT` to choose the columns you need `FROM` one or more tables, then filtered rows with `WHERE`, a common further step is to use `GROUP BY` to aggregate (or sum up) values in one or more columns by the values within another column (or columns). For example, to aggregate your data by a date column.  

1. The oracle Tutorial [Aggregating Rows](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_G1UNQOOO9YNU723ZMVP6EGJIO.html){target="_blank"} describes how to both aggregate rows and use `DISTINCT` to find unique values.

2. In DataCamp use chapter 3 of DataCamp's [Introduction to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql){target="_blank"}.

3. And the [w3schools GROUP BY tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_groupby.asp){target="_blank"}.

# `HAVING` filters the aggregated data from the `GROUP BY`

`HAVING` is how you filter rows that have been aggregated with a `GROUP BY`. You can think of it as a version of `WHERE` created only to filter the results of a `GROUP BY`.

1. See the [w3schools HAVING tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_having.asp){target="_blank"}.

# `ORDER BY` will order or sort rows by one or more columns

Your data often needs to be sorted in a logical order using `ORDER BY` so that it is ready to present to a client when exported, for example.

1. Oracle methods that are common to most SQL flavours to sort rows are covered well in [Sorting and Limiting Rows](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_GMY4RMH9LDCPYKJC615PEOZHT.html){target="_blank"}.

2. And the final chapter 4 of DataCamp's [Introduction to SQL](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-sql){target="_blank"}.

3. And the [w3schools ORDER BY tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_orderby.asp){target="_blank"}.

# `UNION` and `UNION ALL`

Joins in SQL combine columns from two or more tables. However, you may simply want to stack two tables on top of each other where the columns are the same. This is where 'UNION ALL' is required. In contrast, `UNION` will remove any duplicate rows it finds. In other words, joins combine tables in columns, and union combines rows with the same columns. 

The image below shows a join:

1. Please try the Oracle tutorial [Union, Minus and Intersect](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_GPSAXIY7KMDX4ALZX654OXY6S.html){target="_blank"}.

2. And chapter 3 of the Datacamp course [Joining Data in SQL](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/joining-data-in-postgresql){target="_blank"}.

3. And the [w3schools UNION tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_union.asp){target="_blank"}.

# Handling nulls

Null values are a challenge in every data tool. There are specific methods depending on the flavour of SQL you are using. 

1. Here is the Oracle course on [Querying Null-valued Rows](https://livesql.oracle.com/apex/livesql/file/tutorial_GIEX74ES22UVSEOB0CL100ZL1.html){target="_blank"}.

2. And the [w3schools NULL Functions tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/sql_isnull.asp){target="_blank"}. 

# Cheat sheets

Once you are familiar with these key skills and have used them a few times, cheat sheets are a good way to quickly remind you of what you have forgotten. There are many SQL cheat sheets online, but this [KDnuggets cheatsheet](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2018/07/sql-cheat-sheet.html){target="_blank"} combines the SQL code you need with a clear plain English explanation.

# What next?

Once you have mastered the fundamentals, we encourage you to write literate SQL using Common table expressoins. This is the next tab along in this guide.
